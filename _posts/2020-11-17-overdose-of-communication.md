Actually this post has nothing to do with his title. I was reading some of the thoughts
of James Baudrillard about the consumer society and just re-realized the quote from The Matrix 
movie: "Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living." We are
just living the same production/consuming cycles over and over again.

I'ts funny how Baudrillard refers to it as an endless Apocallypsis. But actually it is. Most
of us realized it at some point and just get through it as an skeptical consumer or an 
outsider that tries in some way to fight or accelerate the timing of this cycles trying
to stay focused on what we believe it's real. So things like old unix systems, nice 
programming languages as Ruby, not only because of it's cool and friendly but because of the
philosophy it holds inside because of it's creator awareness of this phenomena,
the impermanence of things, and some other concepts fairly more extended in Asia that now
are being feed (again) into occidental culture. But not in the form of pseudo-spirituality
full of LSD and special effects but as a new point of view about current consumer society.

We are totally misunderstanding the aesthetics enhancements that brings spirituality. With a 
new concept of consumption that calls for this "symbolic eyes" and unreal perception
of what Zen means to reality or even spirituality. 

In brief... this only makes me feel more comfortable using again and again the work of the
elder wizards like the people behind the FreeBSD project, Ruby On Rails and more recently
Ember.js as a way to avoid this spiral of auto-destruction we call society nowadays.

It's time to seat back and see the system trying to do a very-fast-hard-reset.
